# S/4HANA Sales Order Simulation Sample Plugin

## Description

SAP Commerce Cloud, cloud ERP edition exposes an extension point for price calculation with an external provider. This extension point lets you integrate with external calculation service providers or with a custom calculation service of your choice.

The S/4HANA Sales Order Simulation Sample Plugin demonstrates how to integrate SAP S/4HANA with the calculation extension in SAP Commerce Cloud, cloud ERP edition. The plugin creates the "Simulate Sales Order by an External Provider" extension configuration and provides the required data mappings for this extension. It uses the SAP S/4HANA Sales Order Simulation API (`POST /SalesOrder`) to simulate sales order pricing, discounts, taxes, and freight charges in the cart and during checkout.
